### How to run code ###
# SOME Global Variables
    MAX_WORKERS - set to 1 for no parallel processing, n number for max workers otherwise
# Go down to main() in main.py:
    run main.py
    follow instructions on matplot
    -in section part 2.2 in code for hybrid images
    --comment out pairs of images you dont want to see, leave the one u do
    - there is hybrid_image with color and one without, make sure to comment one of the functions in main() out if you dont want to use it
    -main() will run through all parts of proj_2 and can be adjusted by commenting out the desired parts in main()
